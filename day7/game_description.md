# Game Description Document: **Tic Tac Toe Evolution**

## Overview

**Tic Tac Toe Evolution** is a competitive, ever-changing twist on the classic game of tic tac toe. Two players face off in a series of rounds, starting with the familiar 3x3 grid. After each round, the game evolves: players vote on unique "Game Modifiers" that alter the rules, board, or win conditions for the next round. With each new modifier, the game becomes more unpredictable and strategic, challenging players to adapt and outthink their opponent in a constantly shifting landscape.

The game strikes a perfect balance between lighthearted fun and strategic depth, where modifiers stack to create increasingly complex and entertaining scenarios. What starts as simple tic tac toe transforms into a dynamic battle of wits where players must master ever-changing rules and board configurations.

4. **Game Structure Modifiers:** Affect the overall game flow
   - Round Count Changes: Modify total number of rounds
   - Point Multipliers: Certain rounds worth more points
   - Sudden Death: First to win a round after certain conditions

#### Modifier Pool
- **Target:** Approximately 100 unique modifiers

- Simultaneous Moves: Both players place marks simultaneously

**Board Modifiers:**
- Board Expansion: The board's X dimension increases by 1 (e.g., 4x3, then 5x3, etc.)
- Shifting Board: After each move, all X's and O's shift in a cardinal direction (if possible)
- Board Rotation: The entire board rotates 90 degrees after each move
- Holes in Board: Random positions become unusable for the round

**Win Condition Modifiers:**
- Win Condition Change: The number of marks in a row needed to win increases by 1
- Diagonal Only: Only diagonal wins count (no horizontal/vertical wins)
- Pattern Wins: Specific patterns like L-shape or T-shape become winning conditions
- Color Match: Players must match their own color pattern to win

### User Interface & Experience
