# Shape Runner: Chaos Chambers

A unique arcade game prototype built with pygame-ce, inspired by classic arcade mechanics and featuring colored shapes for visuals.

- **Levels:**
  - **Level 1:** Dodge falling blocks and collect coins. Survive to the end to advance.
  - **Level 2:** Enemy shapes move horizontallyâ€”avoid them while still dodging and collecting. (Coming soon)
  - **Level 3:** Power-ups appear and the chamber scrolls faster. (Coming soon)
