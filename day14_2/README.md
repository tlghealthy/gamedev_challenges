# ShapeShift Showdown

A unique arcade game prototype built with pygame-ce, combining classic mechanics in a new way.

## Game Concept
- **ShapeShift Showdown** is a fast-paced arcade game where you control a shape that can morph between circle, square, and triangle forms.
- Each form interacts differently with colored obstacles and power-ups.
- The goal is to survive as long as possible, score points, and adapt to ever-changing challenges.

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move your shape up, down, left, and right.
- **Spacebar**: Morph to the next shape (Circle → Square → Triangle → Circle).
- **Esc**: Quit the game.

## Rules
- Obstacles and power-ups appear in different colors and shapes.
- Only matching your current form and color to an obstacle lets you pass through safely.
- Mismatched collisions end the game.
- Collect power-ups for bonus points and temporary abilities (e.g., speed boost, invincibility).
- The game speeds up over time, increasing difficulty.

## Objective
- Survive as long as possible.
- Score points by passing through matching obstacles and collecting power-ups.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pygame-ce

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pygame-ce`
2. Run the game: `python main.py`
