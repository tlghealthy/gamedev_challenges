# Abstract Arcade: Orb Collector

A unique arcade game prototype using pygame-ce. Move, dash, collect orbs, and avoid enemies!

## How to Play
- **Move:** Move your mouse to control the player (blue circle).
- **Dash:** Press and hold `Space` to dash quickly in the direction of your mouse. Dashing has a cooldown (white arc around player).
- **Collect Orbs:** Touch yellow orbs to collect them and increase your score. Orbs move around the arena.
- **Avoid Enemies:** Red enemies spawn from the edges and move toward the center. If you touch an enemy, it's game over.
- **Restart:** After game over, press `R` to restart.

## Rules
- Collect as many orbs as possible to increase your score.
- Avoid all enemies. One hit ends the game.
- Use dashing strategically to escape danger or grab orbs quickly.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `pygame-ce` (install with `pip install pygame-ce`)

## Run the Game

python arcade_game.py
```
