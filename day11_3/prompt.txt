Create a game state manager which can be dropped into most small pygame projects and easily integrated.
Assume projects that use it will use pygame-ce.
Before coding, create a systems design plan in the Readme.md.
Use a compact coding style where few lines are used but each line still has high clarity.
Keep the interface simple.
Write at least one good test which demonstrates the features well.
