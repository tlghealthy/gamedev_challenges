Code a reusable position based dynamics physics engine for pygame prototypes.
Use settings.json for constants and adjustable variables.
Focus on keeping the whole thing small and lightweight.
The games it will be used for will have less than 200 physics objects at one time.
We want to get the most bang for the buck in terms of physics based gameplay.
Support soft ropes and ridgid objects and allow for a variety of stiffness.
