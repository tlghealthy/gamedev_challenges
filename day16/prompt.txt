Make a beat 'em up game featuring 2 mechanics: bouncing and leveling up and give the game a feeling of noir
Develop the game in 3 phases:
Phase 1: phase 1 is to create the game design document
Phase 2: phase 2 is to create the object oriented design document
Phase 3: phase 3 is to create the code based on the first two documents
Use godot engine to develop the game
Use placeholder art and sounds which can easily be replaced with actual art and sounds
Use godot development techniques that don't depend on the editor gui if possible, prefer using code to create the game
Prefer a coding style which is compact and efficient
