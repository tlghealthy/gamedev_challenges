Make a short shmup game that plays for around 10min per run.
Use procedural generation to generate interesting enemy patterns and attacks.
Each run should feel unique because enemys and attack attributes are randomized within reasonable ranges.
Use shapes and colors of varying size for all visuals.
Utilize pygame-ce and any helpful libraries to complete the game.
Prefer a coding style which is compact and efficient.
